# Projects

## 1. HealthGate

#### Note: The app is only for verified community health workers.

HealthGate is a project that addresses the inequity of vaccine delivery by combining NFC technology with current immunization practices.

The solution is a mobile app for community health workers which store vaccination record data on an [NFC card](https://www.androidauthority.com/nfc-tags-explained-271872/) which is given to the parents, and a copy of the data on the cloud. This digitizes the record keeping process, ensuring that data is not lost and can be used in the future to improve vaccination drives.

The HealthGate project has received a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as a part of grand challenges explorations:
